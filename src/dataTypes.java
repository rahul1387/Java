        In Java, data types define the type of values that a variable can hold. Java has two main categories of data types: 1.Primitive data types
         2.Non-Primitive data types.

        /*
        * Primitive Data Types: Primitive data types are the most basic data types in Java, and they represent simple values such as integers, floating-point numbers, characters, and boolean values.
        There are eight types in primitive data types are follows

        * 1 byte = 8bit *

        byte: This data type can hold an 1-bytes signed integer value.
        short: This data type can hold a 2-bytes signed integer value.
        int: This data type can hold a 3-bytes signed integer value.
        long: This data type can hold a 4-bytes signed integer value.
        float: This data type can hold a single floating-point number value.
        double: This data type can hold a double floating-point number value.
        char: This data type can hold a single character value.
        boolean: This data type can hold a boolean value, which can be either true or false.----> is mainly use in conditionals and loops
