        //Data Types are of two types---> Primitive And Non-Primitive data types

        /*
        Primitive Data types---> 1. Int: this is of 4 byte and the range is from -2,147,483,648 to 2,147,483,647.
                                 2. Short: This is of 2 byte and the range is from -32,768 to 32,767.
                                 3. Long (L): This is of 6 byte and the range from -9,223,372,036,854,775,808 to 9,223,372,036,854,775,807.
                                 4. Byte: This is of 1 byte and the range is from -128 to 127.
                                 5. Float(F): This is of 4 byte and the range is beyond to understand.
                                 6. Double (We can use D but not compulsory): This is of 6 byte and the range is beyond to understand.
                                 7. Char (''): This is of 4 byte, and it is support by Unicode.
                                 8. boolean: This will return value of boolean type like true or false.
            Here some Example:
         */
        byte num6 = 12;
        int num1 = 123456;
        short num3 = 333;
        long num2 = 1595784512369L;
        float num4 = 1.1F;
        double num5 = 1.12D;
        char uni = 'A';
        boolean yn = true;

    }
